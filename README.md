# TIA-KOE
&nbsp;
<p>TIA-KOE is a random name given to my game involving the same concept as rock, papper, scissors.</p>

<p>To play the game and win, the process is the following: pin pops the balloon, balloon sticks to the hair and the hair wraps around the pin to win. </p>

<p>The colour scheme used for this site are a simple contrast of purple colours as they fit nicely with the game and games tend to be a darker theme. The main body colour used is #383E5C with a background image over the top for a nice effect underneath the game tiles. The text is white so the contrast is ready to read from the body colour as well as the tile colour as they differ slightly but not enough to effect the readability.

  <h3>Sections:</h3>
<img src="assets/design/nav-design.png" alt="a navigation bar and links">
<h4>Navigation Section</h4>
<p>The navigation element is a primary section that sits in the top right and features on all pages in order for the user to be able to navigate from any page. It consists of the logo and links in order to identify the website and navigate from A to B depending on what the user intends to do. At first I designed a naviagtion element with only 3 links, but after some thought I decided that it needed a fourth link, to help the user naviagte straight to the "Top Seeds and Plants" page as this would probably be a key reason for visiting the site. Also if the site were to expand in size this page would come in handy for many to view other top hits.</p>
<br><br>
<img src="assets/design/header-design.png" alt="a header or hero image from a website">
 <h4>Header/Hero Section</h4>
<p>The header/hero section allows the user to clearly identify what the website is all about. The header description contains the title ‘Learn Seeds & Grow Life’ which gives the user a clear and consice idea about the nature of the website. The title is accompanied by a paragraph giving the user a brief description about what the site provides throughout. Below we have two buttons; a primary button and a secondary button. To differentiate between importance for the user, the primary button is filled showcasing that this is the more important button to click on. To the right of the header description area we have an image of 4 varieties of plants showcasing what a user can achieve by following the steps on the website.</p>
  <br><br>
  <img src="assets/design/seeds-selection-design.png" alt="a section of the website showing 4 options to navigate to">
<h4>Seed/Plants Selection</h4>

<p>In the selection area we have 4 images, each with a title. These are links which a user can click or tap on to be taken to the relevant page. It consists of a title, small description and 4 cards to pick from. The cards use illustrations from an external source which is listed below. Behind the image is a small rounded shape which makes the images pop and pushes towards the user for interaction should they wish.</p>
<br><br>
<img src="assets/design/footer-design.png" alt="a footer with links from the website">
<h4>Footer Section</h4>
<p>In the footer we reuse the logo to reinforce the identify the website. Below the logo we have three useful sections where we give the user a variety of links to help navigate after reading through the websites current page. The links cover all the main pages on the website and also include links out to social media pages. As a small company these links can help generate interest through external websites to promote products and interact with loyal seed lovers.</p>
<br><br>
<img src="assets/design/seeds-page-design.png" alt="a section from the seed and plants listings">
<h4>Seeds & Plants Section</h4>
<p>On the seeds info and guide page it displays a variety of seeds along with the key info about each choice. I designed this page with a two by two grid as it makes for easy reading and viewing as well as being broken down easily for mobile devices. After I designed the page and started doing some userbility testing I quickly realised it needed something on the page to navigate to the other types of seeds and plants, this was something that I completely overlooked until it was in testing stage so the links below the title were added for ease of use throughout the pages and works well.
<br><br>
<img src="assets/design/about-us-design.png" alt="an about us section from the about us page">
<h4>About Us Section</h4>
<p>In the about section we have a short paragraph briefly explaining the birth of the website and goals along with some relevant imagery to add interest to the page.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="assets/design/contact-us-design.png" alt="a section from contact us page displaying the form">
  <h4>Contact Section</h4>
  <p>Here we have a basic contact form that users can fill out with any queries or concerns about the info provided on the website Seids</p>

<h3>Future Enhancements and Improvement of Features:</h3>

<p>In time this site could become a live e-commerce website with the buying and selling of seeds becoming its primary feature, alongside providing key information on choosing and growing plants. It could also include "How To" videos uploaded by well known plant experts giving users tips and tricks or showcasing different types of plants. Also the single page of "Seeds and Plants" could be split up to become multiple separate pages dedicated to individual seeds; with more in depth information along with needs and requirements. </p>

  <h4>CSS</h4>
  <p>Shorthand of 'flex' not a valid declaration, this was used 6 times as it was something I knew you could do but unaware of it being wrong in the validation process. I used 'flex: row wrap;' and it should be 'flex-wrap: wrap;' with 'flex-direction: row;' This has now changed passed the validation process.</p>
  <p>Accidentally left an 'auto' next to my viewport height for the headers background image. This is now removed and passes the validation</p>

  <h3>Bugs & Fixes</h3>
  <h4>Issue with Image on Header</h4>
  <p>After being told I couldn't use bootstrap I was very anxious to see how easy or hard the coding would be without it. The first bug found was that the image on the header was not placed within the div in a way which it could respond how I thought it would. I tried using its own container as well just adding the code inside the container to the left but I cant get it to act the way I would like and essentially should. The media queries for this also caused an issue because I was using percentages and I wasn't fully confident with what i was typing. The code that had been written was not able to stack the content as intended so I asked about what I could do and got told about flex and flexbox to which I had to implement it all across the site to make it work as best as I could. The fix still isnt perfect with the header image not centering properly with the content on smaller devices but it is now much more desirable than before to a user.
    <br>
  <h4>Image Size on About Page</h4>
  <p>When I initially uploaded the images for this project I thought that the images could be cropped and fitted correctly forgetting there isnt a declaration like background-image and centering the image. This caused me to have to upload a new image and crop it ready for the space intended. It now has dimensions which work for the content.
    <br>
  <h4>Github and Gitpages</h4>
  <p>When I had completed the project I wanted to make sure the site was going to work for public use and therefore found the link to the site. Unfortunately the styling was missing from the website completely. It showed the content from the html pages but nothing from the css pages. I contacted a tutor on how to fix it after I couldnt find an answer from Google or from Slack. The tutor pointed out that they run file paths slightly different which I wasnt aware of. I removed the ../ from the file paths for the images and CSS files and it finally worked.
    <br>
  <h4>Seeds Page</h4>
  <p>I still have a slight issue when viewing this page on certain screen sizes as for some reason it stacks off center and I can't seem to make it right. I have searched online for some extra clues as to why but cant seem to find a solution for my code. I have tweaked the code to the best of my current knowledge and aim to come back to this at some point to see what i can change to make it right.
