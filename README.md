# TIA-KOE
&nbsp;
<p>TIA-KOE is a random name given to my game involving the same concept as rock, papper, scissors.</p>

<p>To play the game and win, the process is the following: pin pops the balloon, balloon sticks to the hair and the hair wraps around the pin to win. </p>

<p>The colour scheme used for this site are a simple contrast of purple colours as they fit nicely with the game and games tend to be a darker theme. The main body colour used is #383E5C with a background image over the top for a nice effect underneath the game tiles. The text is white so the contrast is ready to read from the body colour as well as the tile colour as they differ slightly but not enough to effect the readability.

  <h3>Pages:</h3>

<h4>Home Page</h4>
<p>The main home page has a h1 title clearly displayed in white against the purple background to define the name of the game. The two tiles which you can see on the page have been split into two sections; one for explaining how to play the game and the other for learning more about the game as well as playing. Within one of the tiles we have buttons which have two commands taking you to either the game page or a information page on how the game came about.</p>
<br><br>

 <h4>About Game Page</h4>
<p>On this page we have a simple tile with information on the game. It has a small decription of what the game involves and where the game came from.</p>
  <br><br>

<h4>Game Page</h4>

<p>On the game page we have a more in depth page where we have a title of the game at the top clearly displayed in white over the purple background. Below the title there is a back link to go back to the home page and choose another option for those unsure making easy to navigate. For this particular game we have three tiles with the three options: pin, balloon and hair. The aim  of the game is to beat the item that is vunerable to it. The pin will beat the balloon by popping it, the balloon will beat the hair by getting itself stuck to it and the hair will beat the pin because it will wrap itself around the pin.</p>

  <h3>Future Enhancements and Improvement of Features:</h3>

<p>For the future versions I want to elaberate on the on screen activity. I feel in time this project can be brought to life with some cool animations as well as some UI improvements within the game structure. The colours are good but with a less constricted timeline there could be some more colours involved with the static look as well as the interactivity of the game when a user clicks, gets the result back and playing computer only. The content can also be expanded with maybe some more things being added to the about game and also some additional features for the game such as pop ups like I previously mentioned. </p>

  <h3>Bugs & Fixes</h3>
  <h4>Issue with displaying text from clicking an game's item button. </h4>
  <p>Although I didnt realise it at the time I managed to put the .innerHTML seperate to the document.get which meant the text was not displaying as it should have within the games window. 
  <h4>Images not displaying on the README file</h4>
  <p>When inputting the images link I typed in the images and the design folder when the images for the project only in the design folder underneath the assets folder but that was a simple removal and it worked fine.</p>
  <h4>Repitition</h4>
  <p>After a discussion with my mentor he explained that what I had done was fine but I repeating myself a bit makes it harder further down the line with using the functions in different ways and condensing it meant the code will always be there but in a cleaner way if needed moving forward. We condensed three functions for the loss, win and draw in to a switch statement to make it easier to read and understand should there be an issue with the code.</p>
